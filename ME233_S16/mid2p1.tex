\section*{Problem 1}

Consider the discrete-time system
\begin{align*}
    (1 - 0.7 q^{-1}) y(k) = q^{-1} (1 - 0.5q^{-1}) (u(k) + d(k))
\end{align*}
where $q^{-1}$ is the one-step delay operator, $u(k)$ is the controlling input, $y(k)$ is the measured
output, and $d(k)$ is the disturbance acting on the system. For this problem, $d(k)$ satisfies
\begin{align*}
    d(k) & = d_1(k) + d_2(k)
\end{align*}
where $d_1(k) = d_1(k+2)$ and $d_2(k) = d_2(k+3)$ for all $k$.

$\,$

\noindent Design a controller that achieves the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    The system output perfectly tracks an arbitrary desired output $y_d(k)$, which is known at least one step in advance.

    \item
    The set of closed-loop poles of the system only includes poles at the origin and any plant zeros that are being canceled by the control scheme.
    
\end{itemize}
Clearly indicate all steps of your design process, which includes solving a Diophantine (Bezout) equation.
