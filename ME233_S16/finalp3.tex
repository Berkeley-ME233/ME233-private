\section*{Problem 3}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item
    Write down the statement of a deterministic infinite time LQR problem
    for a standard discrete LTI system. Write down the equation that
    needs to be solved to obtain the optimal state feedback controller.
    What is the optimal gain in terms of that solution?
    \item
    Under what conditions does a bounded solution exist? Under what
    conditions is it unique?
    \item
    How does the cost function differ in a frequency shaped LQR problem?
    Write a state space realization for the frequency weighted (filtered)
    state and input contributions to the FSLQR problem and express the
    solution for the optimal control as a conventional LQR problem for
    an augmented system.
    \item
    Draw the block diagram for the closed loop augmented system,
    including internal states and filtered outputs for the realizations
    of the frequency shaped state cost and input cost.


\end{enumerate}
