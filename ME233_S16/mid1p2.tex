\section*{Problem 2}

Two scalar random variables $X$ and $Y$ are independent and identically distributed. Their sum $Z = X + Y$ is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item
    State the conditions that the pdf of $X$ and $Y$ must satisfy, in the continuous case and the discrete case (where $Z$ takes on any of $n$ possible values evenly spaced between 0 and 1). You do not have to solve for the exact pdf.
    
    \item
    Sketch the approximate shapes of the pdf and cdf of $X$ and $Y$, particularly the boundary points.

    \item
    Sketch the pdf of $X + Y + W$ where $W$ is a third random variable that is independent to and has the same distribution as $X$ and $Y$.

    \item
    What does the central limit theorem state about the result of continuing this process?
    
\end{enumerate}
