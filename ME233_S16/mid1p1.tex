\section*{Problem 1}

Consider the discrete-time linear time-invariant system
\begin{align*}
    x(k+1) & = Ax(k) + Bu(k) \\
    y(k) & = Cx(k) + Du(k)
\end{align*}
where $D$ is square, i.e.\ the system has the same number of inputs as outputs. $D$ is not necessarily symmetric, but assume here that $D + D^T \succ 0$. We would like to design an optimal control policy to minimize
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} 2 u^T(k) y(k) .
\end{align*}
Solve this problem by dynamic programming, introducing a cost-to-go function
\begin{align*}
    J_m^o[x_m,N] = \min_{u(m),\ldots,u(N-1)} \sum_{k=m}^{N-1} 2u^T(k) y(k) \quad \textrm{s.t.} \quad x(m) = x_m
\end{align*}
for $m = 0,1,\ldots,N$. The solution can be expressed using a Riccati recurrence that depends on $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.
