\item
A product is produced by three different factories: A, B, and C. Factories A, B, and C respectively produce 25\%, 50\%, and 25\% of the total production. In factories A and B, 98\% of the items produced are not defective, whereas in factory C, 99\% are not defective. Calculate: (a) The probability that a randomly-chosen item is defective and (b) the probability that a (randomly-chosen) non-defective item comes from factory C.

%Hint: Let events $A$, $B$, and $C$ respectively correspond to a randomly-chosen item coming from factory A, factory B, and factory C. Let events $D$ and $N$ respectively correspond to the event that the item is defective and the event that the item is not defective. Then $P(A) = 1/2$, $P(B) = P(C) = 1/4$, $P(D|A) = P(D|B) = 1/100$, and $P(D|C) = 3/100$. Construct an array of probabilities, fill in its entries, and use the definition of conditional probability to compute $P(A|D)$ and $P(C|N)$.
