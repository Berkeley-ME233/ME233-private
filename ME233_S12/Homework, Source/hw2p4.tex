\item
Let $X \sim N(10,2)$, $V_1 \sim N(0,1)$ and $V_2 \sim N(0,2)$ be independent random variables. Assume that you are trying to make a measurement of $X$ with two different instruments. Let  $Y = X + V_1$ be the measurement of $X$ using the first instrument and $Z = X + V_2$ be the measurement of $X$ using the second instrument, where $V_1$ and $V_2$ are respectively the measurement noises of the first and second instruments.

\begin{enumerate}

\item
Determine $m_{_{X|Y=9}}$, i.e. the conditional expectation of $X$ given that the first instrument yielded the measurement $Y=9$.

\item
Determine $m_{_{X|Z=11}}$, i.e. the conditional expectation of $X$ given that the second instrument yielded the measurement $Z=11$.

\item
Determine $m_{_{X|(Y=9,Z=11)}}$, i.e. the conditional expectation of $X$ given that the first and second instruments respectively yielded the measurements $Y=9$ and $Z=11$.
