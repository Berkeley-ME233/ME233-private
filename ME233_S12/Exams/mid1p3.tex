\section*{Problem 3}

In this problem, we consider the discrete-time linear time-invariant system
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    x(k+1) & = Ax(k) + Bu(k) \\
    y(k) & = Cx(k)
\end{aligned} \label{eq:p3_system}
\end{equation}
where $u(k)$ is the control input and $y(k)$ is the output of the system.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item
    Find the optimal control policy $u_1^o(k)$ that minimizes the cost function
    \begin{align}
        J = y_f^T(N) \, y_f(N) + \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \left[ y_f^T(k) \, y_f(k) + u^T(k) R \, u(k) \right]
        \label{eq:p3_cost}
    \end{align}
    for the system \eqref{eq:p3_system} where $R \succ 0$, $y_f(k)$ is defined by
    \begin{align*}
        x_f(k+1) & = A_f \, x_f(k) + B_f \, y(k) \\
        y_f(k) & = C_f \, x_f(k) + D_f \, y(k)
    \end{align*}
    and $x_f(0) = 0$. 
    
    Also find the corresponding value of the optimal cost.
    
    \item
    Suppose we now make the restriction for $k=0,\ldots,N-1$ that $u(k)$ can only be an explicit function of $x(0),\ldots,x(k)$. Under this restriction, find the optimal control policy $u_2^o(k)$ that minimizes the cost function \eqref{eq:p3_cost} for the system \eqref{eq:p3_system}. 
    
    Also find the corresponding value of the optimal cost.
    
    \textbf{Hint: } The optimal control policy can be written as the output of a state space system that has $x(k)$ as its input.
    
    
\end{enumerate}
