\section*{Problem 2}

Consider the discrete-time linear time-invariant system
\begin{align*}
    x(k+1) & = Ax(k) + Bu(k) + B_w w(k) \\
    y(k) & = Cx(k) + v(k)
\end{align*}
where $w(k)$ and $v(k)$ are independent zero-mean white Gaussian sequences, $u(k)$ is the control sequence to be designed, and $y(k)$ is the measurement sequence available to the controller. The sequences $u(k)$ and $y(k)$ are both scalar. Also, $(A,B)$ is stabilizable and $(C,A)$ is detectable.

In this problem, we investigate two control design problems. The first control design problem is a standard optimal linear quadratic Gaussian control problem
\begin{align}
    J(\rho) = \min_{K \in \mathcal{K}} E\{ x^T(k) Q x(k) + \rho u^2(k) \}
        \label{eq:p2_LQG}
\end{align}
where $\mathcal{K}$ is the set of causal output feedback controllers for the system. The second control design problem is an optimal linear quadratic Gaussian control problem with a variance constraint on the control sequence
\begin{align}
    \bar{J} = \min_{K \in \mathcal{K}} E\{ x^T(k) Qx(k)\}
        \qquad \textrm{subject to} \qquad E\{u^2(k)\} \leq \alpha
        \label{eq:p2_constrLQG}
\end{align}
The control design parameters satisfy $Q \succeq 0$ and $\rho > 0$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item
    Suppose that, for a particular value of $\rho > 0$, we have determined the value of $J(\rho)$. Prove that for any causal output feedback controller that achieves
    \begin{align*}
        E\{ u^2(k) \} \leq \alpha
    \end{align*}
    it must hold that
    \begin{align*}
        E\{ x^T(k) Qx(k) \} \geq  J(\rho) - \alpha \rho
    \end{align*}


    \item
    Suppose that, for $\rho = \rho_* > 0$, the controller that solves \eqref{eq:p2_LQG} satisfies
    \begin{align*}
        E \{ u^2(k) \} = \alpha
    \end{align*}
    Show that this controller solves \eqref{eq:p2_constrLQG} and $\bar{J} = J(\rho_*) - \alpha \rho_*$.



\end{enumerate}
