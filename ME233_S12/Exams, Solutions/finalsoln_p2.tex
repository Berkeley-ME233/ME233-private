\section*{Problem 2}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item
    Suppose a causal output feedback controller achieves $E\{u^2(k)\} \leq \alpha$. Since the control law is suboptimal in terms of the cost function $J(\rho)$, we have
    \begin{align*}
        J(\rho) & \leq E \{ x^T(k) Qx(k) + \rho u^T(k) u(k) \} \\
        & = E \{ x^T(k) Qx(k) \} + \rho E \{ u^T(k) u(k) \} \\
        & \leq E \{ x^T(k) Qx(k) \} + \alpha \rho
    \end{align*}
    Rearranging terms, we have
    \begin{align*}
        E \{ x^T(k) Q x(k) \} \geq J(\rho) - \alpha \rho
    \end{align*}

    \item
    From the previous part, we know that any control law that satisfies $E\{u^2(k)\} \leq \alpha$ must also satisfy $E \{ x^T(k) Q x(k) \} \geq J(\rho_*) - \alpha \rho_*$. This implies that $\bar{J} \geq J(\rho_*) - \alpha \rho_*$.

    It now remains to show that the control law that optimizes $J(\rho_*)$ achieves this lower bound on $\bar{J}$. For the control law that optimizes $J(\rho_*)$, we have $E\{u^2(k)\} = \alpha$ and
    \begin{align*}
        J(\rho_*) & = E \{ x^T(k) Qx(k) + \rho_* u^T(k) u(k) \} \\
        & = E \{ x^T(k) Qx(k) \} + \rho_* E \{ u^T(k) u(k) \} \\
        & = E \{ x^T(k) Qx(k) \} + \alpha \rho_*
    \end{align*}
    which implies that
    \begin{align*}
        E \{ x^T(k) Q x(k) \} & = J(\rho_*) - \alpha \rho_*
            & E\{u^2(k)\} & \leq \alpha
    \end{align*}
    Therefore, this control law satisfies the variance constraint on the control input and achieves the lower bound on $\bar{J}$ given by $J(\rho_*) - \alpha \rho_*$. Therefore, this control law optimizes the linear quadratic Gaussian control problem with a variance constraint and the corresponding cost is $\bar{J} = J(\rho_*) - \alpha \rho_*$.
